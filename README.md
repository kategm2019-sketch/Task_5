# Task_5
Triangle Minimal Path

This project solves the problem of finding the minimal path sum in a triangle of numbers.  
The program reads a triangle from the console, calculates the minimal sum from top to bottom, and reconstructs the path.

Input Format

1. Number of test cases `t`.
2. For each test case:
   - Number of rows `n`.
   - `n` rows of numbers, each row with `i+1` elements.

Example:
1
4
2
3 4
6 5 7
4 1 8 3

Output Format

Minimal path: 2 -> 3 -> 5 -> 1
Result: 11
